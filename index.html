							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a student in high school. People say I’m naturally quiet. While I may come out as shy and reserved to people who don’t know me, I’m actually quite talkative. The reality of the matter is I rarely make the first approach to talk to strangers. I’m also very funny to people who have a knack for my humor. My jokes go over the heads of many people, because they do not understand the intellect behind them. To my friends however, they can’t get enough of them. I also make music on my own, although not on a commercial level. I write music and play the guitar. My other love is nature walks. Nothing keeps my spirits burning with joy than an adventurous expedition into the wild. Whether it is traversing plain lands or making our way through forests, I’m okay with it as long as it is far away from the city.</p>

                                <p>Quiz bowl is a competitive activity in which players attend periodic tournaments. One of the tournaments that I attended was televised on WGBH.</p>

                                <p>I enjoy taking code and turning it into something that entertains people or makes their life easier. So far, I have created a few games, such as Brick Breaker, and a mock interface for a bank.</p>

                        <p><br>Gracious Professionalism is part of the ethos of FIRST. It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process. Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended. In the long run, Gracious Professionalism is part of pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity.</p>
                        
                        <p>Coopertition® produces innovation. At FIRST, Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. Coopertition is founded on the concept and a philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each other even as they compete. Coopertition involves learning from teammates. It is teaching teammates. It is learning from Mentors. And it is managing and being managed. Coopertition means competing always, but assisting and enabling others when you can.</p>
